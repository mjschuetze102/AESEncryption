# EncryptionImplementations
Implementation of various encryption algorithms including:
  * AES

Note: Please do not assume that these are 100% secure. There are many libraries for security out there.
      This is just a repo for me to mess around with the various algorithms in order to better understand
      the underlying architecture.
      That being said, if you know of any vulnerabilities in my implementations, please share so I can
      further my learning :D
